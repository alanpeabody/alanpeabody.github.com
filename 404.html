      <p>At one time there existed a very rarely updated blog which received very little traffic. That blog is gone.</p>
      <p>Any articles that were once useful are so very far out of date that they are worthless. I offer the following resources instead:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='http://stackoverflow.com/'>StackOverflow</a> - The best place for programmers to find Answers and ask Questions.</li>
        <li><a href='http://alanpeabody.com/'>My Homepage</a> - In case you were stalking me.</li>
        <li><a href='http://github.com/404.html'>GitHub's 404</a> - In case you want to see what a real 404 page should look like.</li>
      </ul>
